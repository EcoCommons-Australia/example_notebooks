# example_notebooks
Example notebooks for things like: Species Distribution Models (SDMs), data challenges, etc.

EcoCommons is proud to host the 2022 Ernst and Young Better Working World Data Challenge 2022!  These notebooks are using ecological modelling and programming to inform users where frogs are and are predicted to be to potentially inform species conservation.  There are 3 levels:

- Level 1: Local Frog Discovery Tool using Littoria Fallax, or the Eastern dwarf tree frog
- Level 2: Local Frog Discovery Tool using nine important to species conservation,
- Level 3: Frog Counting Tool using many different species and datasets

All notebooks can be run on the EcoCommons coding cloud.
