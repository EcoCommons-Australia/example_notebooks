# example_notebooks
Example notebooks for things like: Species Distribution Models (SDMs), data challenges, etc.

EcoCommons is proud to host the winning notebooks from the 2022 Ernst and Young Better Working World Data Challenge 2022!  These notebooks are using ecological modelling and programming to inform users where frogs are and are predicted to be to potentially inform species conservation.  You can find a more detailed explanation of these, along with the winning notebooks, in the folder `Python_Better_Working_World_Data_Challenge_2022`
