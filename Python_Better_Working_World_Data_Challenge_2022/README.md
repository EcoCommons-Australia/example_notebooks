This is the home of the winning notebooks from the 2022 Ernst and Young Better Working World Data Challenge.  Participants were asked to use data from a variety of sources to contribute their code and ideas towards species conservation efforts at a variety of levels.  The three levels available to this challenge were:

- Level 1: Local Frog Discovery Tool using Littoria Fallax, or the Eastern dwarf tree frog
- Level 2: Local Frog Discovery Tool using nine important to species conservation,
- Level 3: Frog Counting Tool using many different species and datasets

All notebooks can be run on the EcoCommons coding cloud under the `scipy-base` environment.
